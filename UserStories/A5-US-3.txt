User Story 3: As a CS314 student, I want to implement the ability to save the game, so that users can start a game where the left off
	
Acceptance Criteria (AC):
	1. The new interface works on the Android platform.
	2. The game retains its Model-View separation design: All 'view' software only accesses functional parts of the game through the AdventureGameModelFacade class.
	3. New tests for your Android Java code are written and pass. Any defects they find are fixed.
	4. All previous JUnit tests are run and pass.
	5. Meet 'Definition of Done' (DoD), below.

Tasks: 10 SP (estimation/actual time)
    (4 hours/? hours) Do research about saving games (All)
    (3 hours/? hours) Implement file system for save (All)
    (1 hour/? hour) Add "Save" GUI button (Zach Fuller)
    (5 hours/? hours) Link button to save implementation (All)

Definition of Done (DoD):
For all user stories:
	GitHub main branch code runs with no warnings and a user can execute all commands at least using the GUI.
	All code changes are reviewed before being merged onto the main branch (see A1, tutorial 5 for instructions on the GitHub Pull Request Code Review System you must use for reviews)
	All code changes are merged into the main branch
For CS314 development:
	All work is done on individual branches with frequent commits and pushes to GitHub before being merged onto the main branch.
	Commit messages include user story and task
	All user stories and point estimates are in GitHub
	All tasks and time estimates and actual time taken are in GitHub
	The overview.txt file for A5 has all required items in it
