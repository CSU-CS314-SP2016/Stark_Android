User Story 1: As a CS314 student, I want implement a difficulty setting, so that the game can be more challenging.

Acceptance Criteria (AC):
	1. The new interface works on the Android platform.
	2. The game retains its Model-View separation design: All 'view' software only accesses functional parts of the game through the AdventureGameModelFacade class.
	3. New tests for your Android Java code are written and pass. Any defects they find are fixed.
	4. All previous JUnit tests are run and pass.
	5. Meet 'Definition of Done' (DoD), below.

Tasks: 10 SP (estimation/actual time)

	All code changes are merged into the main branch
For CS314 development:
	All work is done on individual branches with frequent commits and pushes to GitHub before being merged onto the main branch.
	Commit messages include user story and task
	All user stories and point estimates are in GitHub
	All tasks and time estimates and actual time taken are in GitHub
	The overview.txt file for A5 has all required items in it
