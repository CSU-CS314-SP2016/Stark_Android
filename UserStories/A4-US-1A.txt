1. Split story A: As a CS 314 student, I want to create a new GUI as a new game view, so that the game will run on an Android device. (See the Notes in the Description section below for additional information you need to deliver the acceptance criteria listed below.)
Acceptance Criteria (AC):
	1. The new interface works on the Android platform.
	2. The game retains its Model-View separation design: All 'view' software only accesses functional parts of the game through the AdventureGameModelFacade class.
	3. New tests for your Android Java code are written and pass. Any defects they find are fixed.
	4. All previous JUnit tests are run and pass.
	5. Meet 'Definition of Done' (DoD), below.

	Definition of Done:
    - GitHub main branch code runs with no warnings and a user can
       access a GUI to execute all commands that were possible from the command line version
    - All code changes are reviewed before being merged onto the main branch (see A1,
       tutorial 5 for instructions on the GitHub Pull Request Code Review System you must
       use for reviews)
    - All code changes are merged into the main branch
    - All code is unit tested and all tests pass
