All branches had 100% coverage except for classes Player and AdventureGameView

class Player did not reach 100% coverage because of its method "drop." Within drop,
there is a switch statement for an int, itemNum, however the program
doesn't advance to the switch statement if itemNum is less than 1 or greater than 2.
There is a branch where the itemNum is less than 1 or greater than 2, but we can
never get to it because of the way the previous if statement is structured.

class AdventureGameView did not reach 100% coverage because of a try/catch statement
within its constructor that uses an IOException as a case. This IOException branch
is not covered because we cannot simulate an IOException in this testing environment.
