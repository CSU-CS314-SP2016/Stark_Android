New functionality: Difficulty setting
- To increase the difficulty in Hard mode, we have added an oil mechanism - the final door
containing the gold bars will not open without oil.
- We have also added a room that you will end a player's game if entered.

New functionality: Save button
- The player can now save their previous game information and load it
the next time they launch the application

- The Abstract Factory pattern has been applied with the CaveSite interface
and the classes Room and Wall. The CaveSite is an abstract product that allows
the creation and linkage of Rooms and Walls.

How To Guide for New Players
- Navigate through the cave to find hidden treasure
- Hard mode has increased difficulty
	> Rusty doors will not open without Oil
	> Be careful of the false treasure room...
- To load the previous game, press Load button on home screen
